# Developing Sites for the Web

## Why I Completed This Course

As part of the Web Development Fundamentals series, I completed the Developing Sites for the Web course to deepen my understanding of the specific languages and methodologies used to build websites. This course builds upon the foundational knowledge from the previous module by diving into practical applications and industry-standard practices.

## What I Learned and Practiced

**This course provided an in-depth look at key web development topics, including:**

**Core Web Languages:** I gained a solid understanding of the purpose and evolution of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned how these three languages work together to create structured, styled, and interactive web pages, and I can identify the improvements introduced by HTML5.

**Web Browsers:** I now understand the key role that web browsers play in rendering and displaying websites.

**Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):** The course introduced me to the different phases of the SDLC. I can now differentiate between the traditional waterfall approach and the more flexible agile methodology, and I have a basic understanding of the Scrum framework.
